# Welcome to Macrohard

_It was an unusal first day at the Macrohard™ office._

_In fact, it wasn't a day at the office at all._

_Your entire team, freshly recruited from all walks of life, had to work from home due to an ongoing computer virus outbreak. The sudden increase in demand for video conferencing left precious little bandwidth for screen sharing high-resolution integrated development environments so beleaguered developers across the globe went old school, turning to tried and tested technology._

_Equipped with a few good terminal sessions each, you accessed the company unretired mainframe. The plan was for you to not be alone on your first day at work and you all expected to be guided by one of the resident neckbeards. Thus it came as a stark surprise when your shared terminal displayed the message "Out for lunch. You figure it out!". A moment of bewilderment passed as you collectively scratched your heads before another voice was heared over the Moogle Greet™ video conference._

> Hello? Is anyone there? Ah, good!

> It's me, your Commissioned Chief Coach Product Owner, or C3PO for short. I need your help.

> You might have heard of the Y2K problem, yes? Well, have you heard of the Y1.9K problem?

> No? Right, from the start then. It all began with a spreadsheet...


## Incoming Transmission

```
Initiate initiates with installation instructions
-------------------------------------------------
Prepare two (2) reasonably capable terminal sessions/tabs/windows.
  E.g. iTerm2 on macOS.

  If you use macOS, you need to change your terminal's configuration to enable some much needed
  keyboard shortcuts. Remap either the left or the right option key.

    * iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > Keys (select `+Esc`)
    * Terminal > Preferences > Settings > Keyboard (select `Use option as meta key`)

Ensure that ssh is installed on your workstation.
  Unless you have Windows, you should be good to go already.

If possible, use two (2) monitors.
  One for video conferencing.
  One for the two terminals.
